## What is the agency priority? 
Millions of Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) live in the United States and may be eligible to naturalize (the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted after meeting the requirements established by Congress), but have not completed the application process.<sup>1</sup> The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) aims to expand awareness of the nationalization process by making tools and resources available to LPRs and to reach out to engage these communities in creative ways. 

## What did we evaluate?
To begin the naturalization process, applicants must complete the Form N-400 submission process, which is the application required to apply for U.S. citizenship. We collaborated with USCIS to create a letter and web page designed to encourage potentially eligible LPRs to submit a Form N-400 application. The letter used positive and encouraging language, provided a checklist of activities to make the process more manageable, highlighted many of the long-term benefits of becoming a U.S. citizen, and provided statistics showing the pass rates of the naturalization exams. The letter also referenced both the fee waiver process and existing USCIS resources available to connect applicants with free legal services. The letter included a QR code that, when scanned, took the reader to a web page that included the same contents of the letter in multiple languages, a link to file online, and a series of relevant resources available on the main uscis.gov website. Although all the information provided in the letter and web page is publicly available elsewhere, this proactive outreach was a new step that consolidated the information to make it easier to access. Both the letter and web page contents were made available in English, Arabic, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.

## How did the evaluation work?
We evaluated the program change with an individual-level randomized control trial. USCIS identified 1,861,178 individuals potentially eligible to naturalize and mailed identical letters to 300,000 randomly selected individuals between late October and early December 2023. The group was stratified by an individual’s years since LPR status (6, 7, 8, or 9), class of admission (Employment, Family, Spouse, Humanitarian, or Parent), and region of birth (Mexico, China/India, Caribbean, Central/South America, or Other). The remaining 1,561,178 individuals in the control group were not sent the letter. USCIS worked to identify up-to-date addresses for the treatment group, and, in the case when a letter was returned with a forwarding address, they re-sent the letter.

## What did we learn?
We found that this low-cost, scalable effort significantly increased LPRs’ applications for citizenship. Overall, individuals who received the new outreach letter were 1.01 percentage points (p < .001, 95% CI [0.0089, 0.0112]) more likely to submit a Form N-400 application by June 2024, approximately six to eight months after receiving their letter. This translates to an increase of approximately 3,000 additional Form N-400 submissions in the group who received the letter and may have increased overall submissions by 18,600 had we sent letters to the full sample.

Though effects were positive and statistically significant for each stratification group, the largest effects were for individuals whose class of admission to LPR was via spousal or employment-sponsored processes, whose Form N-400 submissions increased approximately 1.4 percentage points. Individuals who classified via parental, spousal, or humanitarian processes exhibited smaller treatment effects from 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points. Other federal agencies looking to increase participation rates in key programs could consider incorporating outreach designed to motivate the reader and consolidate disparate yet relevant pieces of information.
